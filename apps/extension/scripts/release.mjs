 *
 * It is also what scripts/check-release.mjs holds a release's `connect-src`
 * to: the one origin a release may talk to besides itself. Changing it is a
 * change to the privacy policy and to both stores' privacy answers.

 * accepts — which is how a build loaded unpacked can try sync against the
 * real server: `npm run build:as-edge`. In Chrome nothing else has that id; in
 * Edge it would stand in for the store install, so use Chrome.
