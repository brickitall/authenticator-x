/**
 * Runs work one piece at a time.
 *
 * Every vault write is read-modify-write: load the current data, apply a
 * change, re-encrypt the whole payload, store it. `chrome.runtime.onMessage`
 * delivers messages concurrently, so without this two of those interleave —
 * both read the same snapshot, and whichever finishes last silently discards
 * the other's change. That needs no attacker: a popup and a settings tab open
 * at once will do it, and so will the five-minute sync alarm firing while
 * somebody is editing.
 *
 * A failure must not wedge the queue, so the next piece of work runs whether
 * the previous one resolved or threw.
