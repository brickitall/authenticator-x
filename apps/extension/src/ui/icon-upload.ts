/**
 * Turns a picture the user chose into something safe and small enough to live
 * inside the vault.
 *
 * Two things matter here, and neither is cosmetic:
 *
 * 1. **The original bytes are never stored.** The file is decoded and redrawn
 *    onto a canvas, and what gets saved is the canvas's output — pixels this
 *    app produced. That is what makes it safe to put in an `<img src>` later:
 *    anything script-shaped in the source cannot survive being rasterised. SVG
 *    is refused outright rather than relied on to rasterise harmlessly.
 *
 * 2. **It has to stay small.** The sync server rejects a record whose encrypted
 *    box passes 64 KB, and a rejection would surface much later as an account
 *    that quietly stops syncing. Compressing until it fits — and failing loudly
 *    if it will not — keeps that from happening.
