 * produce a clean one: the image is resampled, a screen's black is not ink's,
 * a fixed-focus lens blurs at close range, and the sensor adds noise. On
 * frames modelled that way, a Google Authenticator export of ten accounts —
 * 117 modules a side — read 0/10 with jsQR at 3 px a module and 3/10 at 6. The
 * native reader read it 10/10 from 3 px up. A single-account code was never
 * the problem, which is why a test using one passed while the real export
 * failed on the first person to try it.
 *
 * Chrome ships the native reader on macOS, ChromeOS and Android, not on
 * Windows or Linux, and only in a secure context — which an extension page
 * always is. Elsewhere jsQR remains the reader.
