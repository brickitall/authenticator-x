/**
 * Refuse to call a build a release if it breaks what the store reviewer checks
 * first. Run against `apps/extension/dist` after `npm run zip`.
 *
 * Two of the extension's permission invariants (see docs/architecture.md) are
 * only visible in the built manifest, so this is where they are enforced
 * rather than trusted:
 *
 * - No `host_permissions` and no declarative `content_scripts`. Ever. This is
 *   what keeps "read and change all your data on all websites" off the listing.
 * - No permission beyond the ones the stores were given reasons for.
 * - `externally_connectable` lets the official sync server's pages message
 *   the extension, and no other site.
 * - `connect-src` names 'self' and the official sync server, nothing else —
 *   the origin in apps/extension/scripts/release.mjs, which the privacy policy
 *   and both stores' privacy answers describe. Not localhost because someone
 *   ran the e2e suite last, and not a build with sync quietly switched off.
