/**
 * The recovery kit, carried by the account.
 *
 * Locally, a kit is a second wrapping of the vault's data key under a key the
 * user keeps on paper (see `vault/recovery.ts`). Once a vault syncs, the same
 * kit has to work in two more places: on a new device, when every old one is
 * gone and the password is forgotten; and on the user's other devices, so one
 * printed sheet opens all of them and reissuing it retires the old sheet
 * everywhere.
 *
 * Three values make that possible without giving the server anything it can
 * use:
 *
 * - **`keyCheck`** proves a caller holds the data key. It is what authorises
 *   changing the account's kit, and what a password reset through the kit must
 *   present, so neither a stolen session token nor a stolen recovery wrap is
 *   enough to take an account over.
 * - **`recoveryAuthHash`** proves a caller holds the recovery key, so the
 *   server hands the wrapped key only to someone who could open it anyway.
 * - **The kit state**, sealed under the data key, is what other devices adopt.
 *   The server cannot forge one, and each device refuses a state older than
 *   the newest it has seen, so it cannot roll a retired kit back in either.
