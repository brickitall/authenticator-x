/**
 * Account key hierarchy for zero-knowledge sync.
 *
 * The server must be able to tell that someone knows the master password
 * without ever being able to derive the key that decrypts their vault. One
 * master key is derived from the password, then split into two independent
 * children:
 *
 *     masterKey    = KDF(password, salt)
 *     stretchedKey = HKDF(masterKey, info="authx:v1:enc")   ← wraps the data key,
 *                                                              never leaves the device
 *     authHash     = HKDF(masterKey, info="authx:v1:auth")  ← sent to the server
 *
 * HKDF with distinct `info` strings makes the two computationally unlinkable:
 * an attacker holding `authHash` — from a server breach, or from the wire —
 * learns nothing about `stretchedKey`, and so cannot decrypt a stolen vault
 * without attacking the password itself.
 *
 * The server never stores `authHash` directly either; it stores a slow hash of
 * it under its own random salt, so a database dump is not a login credential.
